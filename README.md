## LangGraph Learning Journey

This repository contains my step-by-step practice with LangGraph, a framework for building LLM-powered workflows using graph structures with nodes, edges, and state management. Each file demonstrates different LangGraph concepts and implementations.

## What it does

- Demonstrates LangGraph fundamentals through practical examples
- Shows how to build workflows using graph structures (nodes, edges, state)
- Explores different patterns: simple graphs, multi-node chains, conditionals, and LLM integration
- Implements state management and memory across conversation turns
- Combines LLMs with external tools for enhanced functionality
- Provides human-in-the-loop control mechanisms

## What I Learned

### 1. Graph Basics
- **Node:** A step or function in the workflow
- **Edge:** Connection that defines flow between nodes
- **State:** Data passed across nodes for memory and context

**Example Flow:**
```
step1 â†’ step2 â†’ step3 (like a cooking recipe)
```

### 2. Multi-Node Graphs
- Multiple nodes chained together for complex workflows
- **Example:** User Input â†’ Greeting â†’ Closing message

### 3. Conditionals & Branching
- Use `add_conditional_edges` for if/else logic flows
- **Example:**
  - If user is student â†’ recommend study tips
  - If user is developer â†’ recommend coding tips

### 4. LLM Integration
- Added LLM (Gemini) node for dynamic responses
- **Flow:** Input â†’ LLM â†’ Output
- Can mix tools (calculator, search API, databases)
- **Rule of thumb:**
  - LLM â†’ reasoning, text generation
  - Tool â†’ factual/external info (math, API, DB)

### 5. State Management
- State keeps memory across conversation turns
- **Without memory:** Bot forgets previous messages
- **With memory:** Bot recalls history, name, preferences

### 6. Customized State
- **Default state:** Simple dictionary
- **Custom state:** Structured model (Pydantic or TypedDict)

**Benefits:**
- Validation (user_input must be string)
- Defaults (history = [])
- Merge rules (append vs replace)

**Example:**
```python
class State(BaseModel):
    user_input: str = ""
    response: str = ""
    history: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)
```

**Result:**
```
ðŸ‘¤ You: hi
ðŸ¤– Bot: I heard you say 'hi'
ðŸ§¾ Conversation so far: ["hi"]
```
